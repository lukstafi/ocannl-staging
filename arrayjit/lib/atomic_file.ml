(* A staging name has to satisfy three things at once, and the first two pull against each other: it
   must be recognizable (the sweep DELETES what it recognizes), it must stay inside the filesystem's
   per-component limit however long the target's name is, and it must be unique among every writer
   that can reach this directory. So the target's contribution is a bounded STEM derived from its
   basename, and everything after the infix is the writer's identity. *)
let max_component_bytes = 255

(* Everything after the infix is FIXED-WIDTH lowercase hex: the pid, the counter, the nonce. Named
   here because three separate things have to describe the same set of names -- the generator, the
   recognizer the destructive sweep consults, and the `.gitignore` rule, which is a glob and so can
   only be exact over fixed widths. A variable-width field forces the glob to spell `[0-9]*`, which
   git reads as "a digit then anything", and an ordinary file with a non-numeric field is hidden
   from its author's own `git status` (Codex P2, round 6). A recognizer looser than the generator is
   the same defect pointed the other way: a licence to delete somebody else's file. *)

   character produces a name that is not valid UTF-8, which Windows refuses to open even though the
   target's own name was fine (Codex P2, round 4). So back off to a byte that does not continue a
   sequence. A name that was not valid UTF-8 to begin with is not made worse: the cut lands where it
   would have anyway, and the digest keeps the stem unique regardless. *)

(* Bounded, and a function of the basename alone — which is what lets the recognizer below rebuild
   it from the target instead of storing it. A long checkpoint name used to fit only because the old
   suffix was four characters (Codex P2, round 2); now it is truncated and disambiguated by a digest
   of the whole name, so two long names that share a prefix still get distinct stems. *)

   and answering "staging" on it would make the sweep destructive over names it was never promised

(* The commit is one [rename], which is atomic on POSIX and on NTFS. It can still FAIL on Windows:
   the C runtime opens files without [FILE_SHARE_DELETE], so while another handle to the target is
   open — a concurrent reader of the same cache entry — replacing it is refused with a sharing
   violation. That refusal is transient by nature (it lasts as long as the other reader's handle),
   so retry before reporting it. Nothing here retries on POSIX: the first attempt succeeds, and the
   loop costs one call.

   The budget is a DEADLINE and not a number of attempts, because on Windows a count of attempts is
   not a duration. [Unix.sleepf] there cannot sleep for less than the system timer tick: measured on
   Windows 11, 0.5 ms returns IMMEDIATELY -- the request truncates to nothing -- while everything
   from 1 ms up costs a full 15.6 ms. The tick is machine-wide and anything in the session can move
   it to 1 ms with `timeBeginPeriod`, so the eight attempts 2 ms apart this used to make were a
   budget of somewhere between 16 ms and 110 ms depending on what else was running.

   No budget makes the commit unconditionally succeed, and the size is chosen knowing that. The
   refusals are not independent draws: measured under the contention
   `test/operations/atomic_file_race` manufactures -- two reader domains opening the target back to
   back while four writers publish -- most are over within one or two polls, but a few percent of a
   percent are refused on EVERY poll for a full second, because a reader that reopens the target as
   fast as it closes it leaves no window at all. So the budget is set where "transient" stops being
   a fair description of the refusal rather than where the last one would have cleared, and a
   refusal that outlives it is reported to the caller, whose business it is: [Schedule_cache.store]
   treats one as a future cache miss. A second is also short enough to report a PERMANENT refusal
   promptly, which matters because nothing here can recognize one -- a read-only target, an ACL, a
   directory in the way and a sharing violation all arrive as the same `Sys_error "Permission
   denied"`. *)
