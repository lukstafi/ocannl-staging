# Interval (min/max) analysis over scalar_t

**Date**: 2026-06-12, elaborated 2026-07-03
**Status**: Elaborated — Phase A ready to implement. Originally seeded by the tinygrad
deep dive ([a-range-is-not-its-shape](../blog/a-range-is-not-its-shape.md), port area 3).
Judged there the best effort-to-payoff item of the six ports; no blocking dependency
([signed-index-precision](signed-index-precision.md) now blocks on *this*).

## Goal

An interval lattice over `Low_level.scalar_t` (and the integer analogue over
`Indexing.axis_index`), in the spirit of tinygrad's `vmin`/`vmax` derived property
(`tinygrad/uop/ops.py`, `_min_max`): `Constant` exact, `Embed_index` bounded by its
loop's statically-known extent, `Get` bounded by dtype range, arithmetic by interval
rules (add endpoints; extremal products; careful div/mod-by-constant cases). Exposed as
an analysis `simplify_llc`'s rewrite arms can consult to discharge validity masks,
prove indices in-bounds, and fold comparisons.

## Key points from the article's analysis

- Four existing efforts independently approximate this one analysis: stage-B
  injectivity in [#133](https://github.com/ahrefs/ocannl/issues/133) (range arithmetic
  over loop extents), read-before-write tracking in
  [#340](https://github.com/ahrefs/ocannl/issues/340), matcher side-conditions in
  [#343](https://github.com/ahrefs/ocannl/issues/343), and the landed surjectivity
  reasoning of [#420](https://github.com/ahrefs/ocannl/issues/420). Intervals are the
  unifying upgrade.
- Sequencing: before the schedule layer
  ([schedule-ir-optops](schedule-ir-optops.md)) — Padto is affordable in tinygrad
  *because* interval reasoning discharges most of the masks it introduces.
- Receiving site exists: `interval_of : scalar_t -> bounds` slots into `simplify_llc`'s
  world; loop extents are statically known from projections.
- **Symbol environment tracks all symbols.** `Embed_index` is where a symbol crosses from
  the index world into the value world, so the analysis threads `symbol → interval` —
  the abstract twin of `visit_llc`'s concrete `symbol → int` env. Completeness is by
  construction: every in-scope symbol at lowering time comes from a `For_loop`
  (`[from_, to_]`) or a static binding (`[0, static_range)`; top when the range is
  `None` — see [signed-index-precision](signed-index-precision.md) on bind-time
  validation). The one env serves both value analysis (`Embed_index` into guards and
  comparisons) and position analysis (`Get`/`Set` `idcs`, the #133/#420-style facts).
  Wiring is already in place: `optimize_proc` receives the full
  `static_indices : static_symbol list` (ranges included) and passes it to every
  candidate host pass; bounds are lost only to the per-pass idiom that strips the list
  to a bare-symbol membership `Set` (low_level.ml lines 613/796/1479 as of 2026-07-03).
  Seeding = building a `symbol → interval` map from the same list before the strip.
  Verify at implementation time that `static_range` (a `mutable int option`) is settled
  before `optimize_proc` runs — dims are forced by lowering, so ranges derived from dims
  should be; assert rather than assume.
- **The memo must be env-scoped.** The same `scalar_t` subtree can be physically shared
  under different loop nests (immutable-tree sharing after rewrites; CSE/`Local_scope`
  reuse), and its interval differs per enclosing scope. Key the memo by (expression,
  symbol-env) or scope it per loop body — a global identity-keyed memo would return
  another scope's bounds.

## Lattice and rules (draft)

Domain: closed intervals over extended reals with an integrality flag,
`{ lo : float; hi : float; integral : bool }`. Top = `[-inf, +inf]` non-integral. No
bottom (expressions always evaluate). NaN policy: any expression that may evaluate to NaN
is top — folding decisions require NaN-freedom, which the integer fragment guarantees and
the float fragment mostly forfeits.

`axis_index` (exact, integral): `Fixed_idx i → [i,i]`; `Iterator s → env(s)`;
`Sub_axis → [0,0]`; `Affine {symbols; offset}` → `offset + Σ coeff·env(s)` with endpoints
picked by coefficient sign. `Concat` is gone by lowering.

`scalar_t`:
- `Embed_index idx` → interval of `idx`, integral.
- `Constant c` → `[c,c]`, integral iff `c` is a whole number; NaN → top. `Constant_bits` → top.
- `Get (tn, _)` → settled `Tnode` bounds (Phase B), else dtype range: integer precs give
  `[0, 2^w)` or `[-2^(w-1), 2^(w-1))` integral; float precs top. `Get_dynamic` likewise
  via the table's node. `Get_local`/`Local_scope` → top in Phase A.
- Binops: `Add`/`Sub`/`Mul` by endpoint arithmetic (extremal products). `Div`: top when
  the divisor interval contains 0, else endpoint rules. `Mod` by a constant `c > 0`:
  `[0, min(hi, c-1)]` when the argument is integral with `lo ≥ 0`, else top (avoids
  C-remainder sign traps). `Max`/`Min`: pointwise endpoints. `Relu_gate`/`Satur01_gate`:
  hull of `[0,0]` and the gated argument. Comparisons (`Cmplt`/`Cmpeq`/`Cmpne`) →
  `[0,1]` integral, folding to a point when intervals decide: `Cmplt` true iff
  `hi1 < lo2`, false iff `lo1 >= hi2`; `Cmpeq` false iff disjoint, true iff both are the
  same singleton. `And` → `[0,1]`, folds when either side is a decided point.
- Ternops: `Where (c, a, b)` → `a` when `c` folds true, `b` when false, else hull;
  `FMA` composes the `Mul`/`Add` rules.
- Unops: `Relu → [max(0,lo), max(0,hi)]`; `Trunc` → truncated endpoints, integral;
  monotone transcendentals map endpoints; non-monotone → codomain bounds or top.
- Precision annotations (`scalar_arg`): arithmetic at prec `p` preserves integrality
  claims only within `p`'s exact-integer range (fp16: 2048, fp32: 2^24, fp64: 2^53) —
  check the annotation before asserting `integral`, else drop the flag and widen.
  Machine-value soundness today: emitted index arithmetic is non-negative by
  construction (physical padding), so no unsigned-wrap modeling; keep a "lower bound
  could cross zero → top" assert until [signed-index-precision](signed-index-precision.md)
  lands.
- Exactness of the bound carrier: the float `lo`/`hi` cannot represent all int64/uint64
  values (dtype-range endpoints like 2^64-1 round). Carry an `exact : bool` bit, cleared
  whenever an endpoint is not exactly representable (in particular |v| >= 2^53).
  Range/ordering folds remain sound with outward-rounded endpoints; equality/singleton
  folds (`Cmpeq` true) are forbidden unless `exact` — two distinct integers may round to
  the same float.
- Float-arithmetic folding policy (Phase A): comparison folds fire only on facts derived
  from exact integral intervals (index arithmetic, integer `Get`s, whole constants).
  Intervals of genuinely float computations are carried conservatively (top, or
  outward-rounded endpoints) and never fold comparisons — real-endpoint arithmetic can
  underapproximate rounded fp results. Revisit with explicit outward rounding if a float
  consumer materializes.
- Unknown-op policy: conservative by construction, but via *exhaustive* matches whose
  currently-unhandled arms (`Or`, `ToPowOf`, `Threefry4x32_*`, `Satur01`, `Recip`,
  `Recip_sqrt`, `Tanh_approx`, `Not`, `Mul3`, ...) explicitly return top — not a `_ ->
  top` wildcard, so adding an op to `Ops` forces a conscious interval-rule decision at
  compile time.
- Truthiness is a derived view, not a lattice facet: definitely-false iff the interval
  is `[0,0]`, definitely-true iff `0` is outside `[lo, hi]`, else unknown. Comparison
  outputs are `[0,1]`-integral points so this is complete for `And`/`Where` over guard
  fragments; a separate "nonzero with mixed-sign range" facet is deferred until a
  consumer needs it.

Designated re-expression target (acceptance criterion): re-derive
`build_guarded_gather`'s three guard flavors. Construct the guard generically (lower
bound, upper bound, integrality conjunct) and let interval folding erase what the ids
precision proves — unsigned `Get` gives `[0, 2^w)` so the lower conjunct folds; integer
precs prove integrality so `Trunc` folds — leaving the current hand-written flavors as
emergent behavior. It is landed, executable, and already golden-tested
(`test_one_hot_embedding_lookup` asserts `Trunc` counts on both paths).

Pass-ordering caveat: the optimize pipeline applies `simplify_llc` *before*
`rewrite_one_hot_reductions` (low_level.ml `optimize_proc`), so a generically-built
guard is born after the only fold pass. Phase A therefore has `build_guarded_gather`
call the interval folder directly on the guard it constructs (local, no pipeline
change, no golden perturbation elsewhere); an additional post-rewrite simplify/fold
pass is the general fix if later rewrites also start emitting foldable code.

## Phasing

- **Phase A** (implementable now): `interval_of` over `axis_index` + `scalar_t` with the
  total symbol env (seeded from `static_indices` before the membership strip),
  env-scoped memo, rules above; consumers: comparison folding in `simplify_llc` and the
  gather-guard re-derivation.
- **Phase B**: `Tnode` vmin/vmax with the propose/settle/conflict lifecycle and
  host-write symmetry (below); consumer: full guard fold for runtime ids. Includes an
  audit of *all* host-write paths, not just `Context.set_values`/`from_host`: direct
  backend init/upload paths, persistence/checkpoint restore, and link-time `Host_inits`
  must participate in propose/settle/validate; device-to-device copies propagate the
  source node's bounds by join (no scan needed).
- **Phase C** (separate proposal, blocks on A):
  [signed-index-precision](signed-index-precision.md) with tnode-granular width
  selection; then logical-padding masks per [schedule-ir-optops](schedule-ir-optops.md).

## Interprocedural layer: vmin/vmax on `Tnode.t`

The `scalar_t`-level analysis is intra-routine; without more, every `Get`/`Get_dynamic`
degrades to dtype range at routine boundaries (a reader routine lowers its own comp; the
writer's defining expression is in a different comp — the tensor node is the only artifact
crossing between them). Store per-tensor scalar bounds (float `vmin`/`vmax` pair, exact for
integer values below 2^53) on `Tnode.t` as writer-derived summaries. Payoff: with ids
settled at `[0, vocab)`, the gh-343 gather guard folds *entirely* for genuinely runtime
ids, not just range-produced ones; same for data-dependent mask discharge.

Soundness design (third instance of the `delayed_prec` lifecycle pattern):

- **Multi-writer staleness**: a guard discharged against bounds, followed by a
  later-compiled wider writer, would leave already-generated code unsound (an OOB read,
  not a wrong zero). So: writers *propose* bounds (joined, like `Inferred` promotion);
  a reader that discharges a guard *settles* them (like forcing the prec lazy); a
  post-settlement writer whose interval does not fit is a compile-time error (like
  `update_prec` on a settled precision).
- **Host writes**: symmetric with compiled writers around the settlement point.
  *Pre-settlement*, `set_values`/`from_host` (and ndarray-backed `init_data` — proposed
  *lazily* when the `Host_inits` buffer is forced at link/upload time, not at tensor
  creation: `Reshape` inits deliberately wait for shape and padding inference, so an
  eager scan would force unresolved dims or miss padding added by `create_with_reshape`)
  act as writers: scan the uploaded values (O(n), trivial next to the copy) and *propose*
  the observed `[min, max]` into the join — or pin the tensor to top if scanning is
  disabled. Otherwise a later reader could settle narrow writer-derived bounds and fold a
  guard against host contents that were never inspected. A bonus: tensors created via
  `class_ids_of_int_list`-style host arrays get tight bounds automatically.
  *Post-settlement*, host writes validate against the settled bounds or error.
- **Self-referential writers** (read-modify-write across executions: param updates,
  accumulators) default to top — a fixpoint over unbounded repetitions is not attempted.
  The profitable cases (ids, range producers, one-hots) are write-once/functional.

[signed-index-precision](signed-index-precision.md) (**blocks on this**, revised
2026-07-03: intervals need no wrap modeling over the current IR — physical padding keeps
emitted index arithmetic non-negative by construction, so the "lower bound could cross
zero" rule is a cheap assert until masks land — while the signed migration waits for
intervals so tnode-granular width selection ships in its final form and the golden churn
is paid once).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Lattice and rules specified (draft above; single lattice with an integrality flag
      rather than two variants; widening not needed — loop extents are finite and
      static).
- [x] Re-expression target designated: `build_guarded_gather`'s guard flavors re-derived
      by folding a generically-constructed guard (implementation lands with Phase A).
- [x] Caching strategy decided: per-node memo, env-scoped (see the symbol-environment
      key point).
- [x] `Tnode` bounds lifecycle specified (propose/settle/conflict semantics mirroring
      `delayed_prec`; host-write symmetry around settlement; self-referential writers
      pinned to top) — implementation is Phase B.
