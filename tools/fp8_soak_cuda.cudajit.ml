(* The CUDA arm of the fp8 soak (gh-ocannl-657): narrow every input with [__nv_fp8_e5m2] and hand
   the codes back. Nothing here knows what the answers are compared against, what the vendor type is
   called in a claim, or which narrowing spellings this platform has -- fp8_soak.ml owns all of that
   (its [ARM] signature and [cuda_vendor] record), because THIS FILE IS COMPILED ONLY ON A BOX WITH
   cudajit and every edit to it is made blind everywhere else (gh-ocannl-758). What belongs here is
   the kernel source and the calls into cudajit; anything else belongs in fp8_soak.ml.

   The kernel casts to the vendor type exactly as [Cuda_backend]'s [convert_precision] emits it:
   [(__nv_fp8_e5m2)x] for a float and for a double, which is a saturating round-to-nearest-even
   conversion done by the hardware. Compiled WITHOUT [--use_fast_math] (which the backend does pass)
   because fast math is about arithmetic and this program does none: the conversion is the whole
   kernel, and the soak should not have to reason about what a relaxed floating-point mode does to
   the thing being measured. *)

(* Everything the sweep needs, held for the whole of it. The two lifetime fields are not decoration:
   [Cu.Context.get_primary] finalizes with [cuDevicePrimaryCtxRelease], and the underlying context
   is RESET once the last reference goes -- so a context dropped after [init] returns can be
   collected mid-sweep and take the device allocation and the loaded code with it. [Cuda_backend]
   keeps its [primary_context] in the device record for exactly this reason. [kernel_module] is belt
   and braces: cudajit's [get_function] already documents that the returned [func] retains its
   module, so this one is about saying the lifetime rather than inferring it from a binding's
   internals -- and about the HIP arm, where the same reasoning has to hold. *)
