(* The GPU half of the e5m2 codec verification (gh-ocannl-657): OCANNL's software codec against the
   vendor's fp8 type, over every input rather than a sample.

   Why this is a tool and not a test: it needs a GPU, and it sweeps 2^32 float bit patterns and
   17.2e9 doubles. The pure-CPU half -- which pins the codec against a rounding oracle and pins the
   two codecs against each other -- is test/operations/fp8_codec_exhaustive.ml, on the `slow` alias.
   What only hardware can answer is whether the codec still agrees with `__nv_fp8_e5m2` /
   `__hip_fp8_e5m2`, which is the property gh-ocannl-646 established by changing OUR rounding to
   match THEIRS, and which a new CUDA or ROCm release can take away.

   The comparison matters because both conversions live inside one tensor: a kernel narrows with the
   vendor cast, while every host-side write of the same fp8 node goes through [Ops.single_to_fp8] /
   [Ops.double_to_fp8]. So the host side here IS the shipped codec (builtins.c, reached through
   fp8_soak_stubs.c) and the device side IS what the backend emits.

   WHICH SPELLING is a question only ROCm makes interesting (gh-ocannl-757). CUDA has one: the bare
   [(__nv_fp8_e5m2)x] the backend emits. HIP has two, because its bare cast is BROKEN for tiny
   magnitudes (gh-ocannl-647) and every OCANNL narrowing there goes through a guarded helper
   instead. So the default sweeps what the backend actually emits -- guarded on HIP, the cast
   everywhere else -- and that run is a pass/fail gate on every box: 0 disagreements. The raw cast
   is then an opt-in probe ([--spelling=raw]), and it does NOT claim agreement, because on an
   affected ROCm it cannot have it; it claims LOCALIZATION -- that every disagreement lies inside
   the window the guard covers -- which is true today, stays true (vacuously) once the platform is
   fixed, and whose disagreement count reaching 0 is the trigger to delete the guard.

   Usage: dune exec tools/fp8_soak.exe -- every arm the box has, both sweeps dune exec
   tools/fp8_soak.exe -- --arm=cuda --sweep=f32 dune exec tools/fp8_soak.exe -- --arm=hip
   --spelling=both Runs in a couple of minutes on an RTX 5070 Ti; see
   docs/agent-notes/backend-precision-and-simd.md.

   Exit status is a verdict: nonzero if any claim failed, so it can gate a release check.

   WHAT LIVES WHERE (gh-ocannl-758): this module is compiled on every box, the per-vendor arms only
   where their jit library is installed, so everything that is not a call into a vendor's jit
   library lives here -- the [vendor] records below hold each platform's name, C type, narrowing
   spellings and labels, and the reading of what its kernel macros mean. An arm holds its kernel
   source, its compile/load/launch/copy calls, and data extractors; its [last_compiled] says where
   and when it last saw a compiler, and the run header prints it. *)

(* An arm narrows inputs with ONE vendor's fp8 type and says nothing about what the answer should
   be. Adding a vendor is adding a module of this shape, a [vendor] record below, and one `select`
   clause in tools/dune -- not a second program, which is how the CUDA sweep and the HIP sweep
   drifted apart the first time.

   THE SIGNATURE IS DELIBERATELY THIN (gh-ocannl-758). An arm file is compiled only on a box that
   has its vendor's jit library, so an edit to one is made blind everywhere else and is first
   typechecked by whichever session next runs on the right hardware -- which happened twice in two
   days. So everything an arm could hold but does not have to CALL THE JIT LIBRARY FOR lives here
   instead: the vendor's name and C type, its narrowing spellings and their labels, the probe and
   header wording, the thresholds that decide which conversion path a macro reading means, and every
   claim label. What remains in an arm is: the vendor kernel source, the compile/load/launch/copy
   calls, and data extractors that read a vendor struct field or a kernel's own report. A change to
   how the soak BEHAVES then never touches an arm; a change to an arm is a change to how this vendor
   is driven. *)

      [cuda_fp8.hpp] guards its conversions with [#if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 890]: at or above sm_89 the
      cast is the hardware conversion instruction, below it the header's software emulation. So
      [`Device] — this GPU's own capability — is the setting that verifies the codec against the
      HARDWARE, which is what gh-ocannl-646 established the codec's rules against, while [`Backend]
      reproduces [Cuda_backend]'s marker-driven policy, which for a source with no tensor-core
      markers passes no architecture at all and lands on the software path. Both are real questions;
      the default is [`Device]. Must be called before the arm's first sweep. An arm whose platform
