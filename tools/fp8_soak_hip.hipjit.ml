(* The HIP arm of the fp8 soak (gh-ocannl-657, brought to real hardware by gh-ocannl-757): the same
   sweep against [__hip_fp8_e5m2], plus the one thing the CUDA arm has no counterpart for — a second
   pair of kernels calling the GUARDED helpers the HIP backend actually emits.

   Two spellings, because on ROCm they are not the same conversion:

   - [`Raw] is [(__hip_fp8_e5m2)x], the platform's own cast. It is BROKEN for tiny magnitudes
   (gh-ocannl-647): an out-of-range shift in [hip/amd_detail/amd_hip_fp8.h]'s [cast_to_f8] returns
   values as large as 2^-14 where every other implementation returns a signed zero. Sweeping it is
   what localizes the defect to an exponent window, and a count of 0 here is the trigger to remove
   the guard (https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/issues/10591). - [`Guarded] is
   [ocannl_single_to_fp8_uniform] / [ocannl_double_to_fp8_uniform] from {!Builtins_hip} — the source
   text, fetched from the backend rather than transcribed, exactly as the host side of this soak is
   the shipped [builtins.c] object code reached by [extern]. This is what an OCANNL HIP kernel
   narrows with, unconditionally since gh-ocannl-647, so it is what "does our codec still agree with
   what our kernels produce" really asks here. It is the default, and the pass/fail gate: 0
   disagreements expected on every ROCm.

   Compiled WITHOUT [-ffast-math], which the backend does pass: fast math is about arithmetic and
   this program does none — the conversion is the whole kernel. The guard's own [fabsf]/[copysignf]
   comparison is fast-math-invariant on finite inputs, which is the class the claims are about. *)

   non-fp8 kernel must still compile on a pre-6.2 SDK: here the fp8 type IS the program, so a

/* Which side of amd_hip_fp8.h's compile-time split the conversions above were built on, asked of
   the COMPILED KERNEL rather than inferred from the device name we happen to know. The header
   defines HIP_FP8_CVT_FAST_PATH to 1 on gfx942/950/1200/1201/1250 under device compilation and to 0
   everywhere else; at 1 the cast is a hardware instruction, at 0 it is the header's own software
   [cast_to_f8] -- which is where gh-ocannl-647's defect lives. A sweep that silently took the fast
   path would report the bug fixed, so the answer goes into every claim's label (the same lesson the
   CUDA arm learned about __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 890, PR #463 round 4). HIP_FP8_TYPE_OCP rides along
