"""The reader of the library's resolved-configuration stream (gh-ocannl-1566), stdlib only.

An OCANNL process run with `--ocannl_log_config_json=true` prints, on stderr, one JSON object per
setting it resolves -- the records `Utils.resolved_config ()` returns, rendered by
`Utils.config_record_to_json` (schema in `ocannl_config.reference`, key `log_config_json`):

    {"ocannl_config":1,"key":K,"value":V,"source":S,"layer":L,"profile":P,"origin":O}

`parse_config_records(text)` picks those lines out of a process's stderr and returns
`{key: {"value", "source", "layer", "profile", "origin"}}`. Every other line is the stream's other
traffic and is ignored; a line that opens with the tag but does not hold a valid record -- a write
another writer tore, an emitter that regressed -- is refused with `ConfigRecordError` rather than
skipped, as is a schema version this reader does not know, and one key resolved two different
ways (the process's sources changed under it: whatever it measured ran under both). The stream
is point-in-time: a process killed early leaves a truthful but incomplete one.

`expect_problems(config, expects)` is the check a driver states a treatment with: each named key
resolved to its value from the command line. Run as a script, `config_records.py expect FILE
KEY=VALUE...` applies it to a stderr file a shell driver kept, and refuses as well any setting that
entered through the environment: exit 0 when the treatment holds, 1 naming each problem, 2 for a
usage error. `config_records.py show FILE KEY...` prints each key's value and provenance for the
driver's log (`(not resolved)` for one the process never read). They are how a driver that keeps
its own cells confirms and records what they ran under, in place of reading the prose
configuration trace (gh-ocannl-1607).
