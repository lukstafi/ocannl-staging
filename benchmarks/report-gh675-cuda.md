# gh-ocannl-675, CUDA leg: does a process that searched time its steps more slowly?

**Box `rog-nv-wsl` (RTX 5070 Ti Laptop, WSL2), 2026-08-23/24.** The sibling ROCm leg
(gfx1151) is the comment on gh-ocannl-675 dated 2026-08-23; this file is the NVIDIA half and the
one that settles the split/no-split call, because it ran second.

**Headline.** On this GPU the only *non-OCANNL* searching cell whose timing process is measurably
slower is tinygrad's `--beam N` -- by **+6.4%** on `mlp_small` and **+2.3%** on `gpt2_mini`, small
but carried by *every* paired repeat (9/9 and 4/4). (OCANNL's own tuned cell is slower too behind
a long search, +10.3%; it is stated separately just below because it is the anchor this whole
question is asked against, not because it is exempt.) `torch.compile` goes the other way: its
searching process is **faster** than the fresh process that replays inductor's cache
(-12.0% / -4.0%), so splitting its passes would penalise it, not credit it. OCANNL's own tuned
cell -- the one the two-pass protocol exists for -- shows a residue only after a *long* search
(+10.3% / +8.4% behind a 16 s search) and none at all behind a 4 s one. **The 2.5-3.5x that
`README.md` attributes to small CUDA kernels does not reproduce here, on the hardware class it
names.**

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| box | ASUS ROG, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU (compute capability 12.0, 12227 MiB), WSL2, kernel 6.18.33.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2, 24 logical cores |
| driver / toolkit | driver 610.62 (CUDA API 13.3), CUDA toolkit 13.3 (`nvcc` V13.3.73) at `/usr/local/cuda` |
| PyTorch | `2.13.0+cu130` (stock Linux wheel), device `cuda` |
| tinygrad | 0.13.0, editable install from `~/tinygrad` at `62273d50f`, device **`CUDA`** (the system nvrtc works here; the README's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` caveat applies only to a driver older than the toolkit, which this box no longer has) |
| other | python 3.12.13, numpy 2.5.1, safetensors 0.8.0 |
| ocannl | worktree of `origin/master` `7014dc44`, backend `cuda`, `BENCH_PRECISION=f32` |
| fixtures | `mlp_small.safetensors` (51384 B) sha256 `f09de9504262eb184672c9f58da821c47e0ee9f6311bd69207700c33298c44ca`; `gpt2_mini.safetensors` (13871360 B) sha256 `043c1ea8b42817fca8b713ac0eadae6e8b7b7326cb5ff7ea0fd527487ca2009e` |

Those are written in full deliberately: the raw records live on the measurement box, so this
checked-in file is the only place a reader can check whether a regenerated fixture is still the
workload these numbers are about. `fixtures/DIGESTS.txt` is NOT the place for them -- it carries no
entries for these fixtures, and adding this box's would break the ROCm leg, whose bytes differ (see
next paragraph); which of the two becomes canonical is a decision for the suite, not for one leg's
report.

The fixture digests differ from the ROCm leg's for the same workload names (same sizes, different
bytes: `gen_fixtures.py` draws from a numpy version that does not promise stream stability).
Absolute step times are therefore **not** comparable across the two legs -- the *ratios* are what
both legs report, and a ratio is taken within one box, one fixture, one pair of processes.
`fixtures/DIGESTS.txt` still carries no entries, so these are recorded here rather than checked
against it.

## Method

- Driver: `benchmarks/gh675_cells.py` (checked in with this report). One arm = one pair of
  processes; arms alternate across repeats rather than running an arm to completion, so a drifting
  box moves both halves of a pair together. Each run is pinned with `taskset -c 0-15` behind an
  idle gate (load average and GPU utilisation).
- **X is the median of the paired per-repeat ratios** (pass-1 `step_ms` p50 over pass-2 `step_ms`
  p50, minus 1), not a ratio of arm-level medians. Repeat 0 of every arm is a discarded warm-up.
- Caches whose warmth *is* the experiment: tinygrad's kernel cache is redirected per arm with
  `CACHEDB=`, and deleted before each pass 1 of the COLD arms (both beam widths and the
  cold-compile control) -- but deliberately NOT for the warm/warm control, whose claim is that both
  its passes replay: that arm is prewarmed once per invocation and its cache is preserved across
  the pair. Inductor gets a fresh `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR` per repeat with
  `TORCHINDUCTOR_FX_GRAPH_CACHE=1`; OCANNL's autotune cache (kept under `$GH675_OUT`, not in the
  checkout) is wiped before each pass 1.
- Provenance is verified, not assumed, and the expectation differs by arm. For the SEARCHING arms
  (both beam widths, both torch.compile modes, the OCANNL tuned cell) every pass-1 row reports
  `searched: true` and every pass-2 row `searched: false`. For the three CONTROLS -- whose whole
  claim is that they do not search -- both passes report `searched: false`, which is equally part
  of what makes them controls. The driver states the expectation per arm and rejects a pair that
  violates it. Reading it at all needed the gh-ocannl-751 patch (see "Two things found on the
  way").
- Parity is the orchestrator's gate recomputed offline against `pytorch/cpu/eager`, tolerance
  2e-3: **every cell passes**, worst 8.7e-07, so all rows are comparable.
- **Known limitation of THIS run's data.** Arms alternated within each repeat but in a FIXED
  order, so every arm sat at the same position in every repeat. Since the process-wide CUDA JIT
  cache warms across a session -- documented below, and worth 16 s vs 4 s of OCANNL search time --
  arm identity is partly confounded with accumulated compiler state. X itself is a within-pair
  ratio between two adjacent processes, which is what makes it robust to that drift; what the
  confound can reach is the comparison BETWEEN arms, and the anchor's two regimes in particular.
  The driver now rotates the arm order per repeat (`gh675_cells.py`), which the numbers below
  predate.

## Results

`X` = (pass-1 step p50) / (pass-2 step p50) - 1, median over paired repeats. `pos/n` is how many
of those paired ratios were positive -- the statistic that separates a small real effect from
noise. `blk2` is the retime control: pass-1's SECOND timed block over pass-2's SECOND timed block
(see below -- matched block positions, so only the process differs). Step times are the
sync-after-every-step `step_ms` p50, i.e. the number the report publishes.

**Per-cell X on this hardware:** tinygrad `beam` **+6.4%** (mlp_small) / **+2.3%** (gpt2_mini);
`torch.compile` default **-12.0%** / **-4.0%**; `torch.compile max-autotune` **-2.0%** / **-1.1%**;
OCANNL `tuned` **-0.0%** / **+0.5%** pooled (but see the anchor section -- pooling hides a split).

## What the controls say

1. **Process-to-process spread.** The three non-searching controls sit at |X| <= 2.5%
   at the median, and their paired ratios are a coin flip (3/9, 4/9, 3/9 positive on `mlp_small`).
   A single repeat of the 0.1 ms cell still swings +/-10%, which is why the beam row is n=9 and why
   the sign count, not the range, is the statistic.
2. **Compilation is not the mechanism.** A tinygrad `--jit 1` cell run with a *deleted* kernel
   cache compiles every kernel in the timing process and comes out at -0.1% / +0.1% against its own
   warm replay, 4/9 and 2/3 positive. The only difference between that control and the beam arm is
   `BEAM=N`.
3. **It is not first-block warmup.** A `--retime` flag (added for this probe) times a *second*
   block of `timed_steps` inside the same process, ~400 steps in -- and BOTH passes record one, so
   the comparison is pass-1 block 2 over pass-2 block 2: same block position, same step index. What
   it does NOT match is elapsed process lifetime -- pass 1 reaches its blocks after 13.5-68.4 s of
   searching, pass 2 after a replay of a second or two -- and that cannot be matched, because it is
   the treatment: a pass 2 aged equivalently would have had to do something equally expensive, at
   which point it is not a replay. So this control excludes block position and step index as the
   explanation, and does not separate "slower because it searched" from "slower because it is an
   older, fuller process that searched" -- which is the same claim the README's stated mechanism
   makes (accumulated modules and buffers), not a competing one. The searching process stays slow:
   **1.07** (mlp_small BEAM=2), **1.11** (BEAM=8), **1.02** (gpt2_mini), against 0.99-1.00 for the
   three controls and 0.83 for `torch.compile`, whose block 2 confirms it is genuinely the *faster*
   process. (An earlier revision of this report divided pass-1's second block by pass-2's FIRST
   one, which left block position confounded with process identity; the matched comparison is the
   one tabulated, and it separates the beam cell from the controls more sharply than the
   confounded one did -- 1.07 vs 0.99-1.00, where the confounded numbers were 1.055 vs 0.97-0.98.)
4. **Beam width is a weak dose-response knob.** BEAM=8 costs 3.4x the search (55 s vs 16 s) and
   moves X from +6.4% to +8.3% -- present, but far from proportional.
5. **The effect is small and one-sided, not large and noisy.** 9/9 + 4/4 + 2/2 positive paired
   ratios across the three beam rows is what makes a ~6% median statable at all; by contrast
   `torch.compile`'s 1/9 and 0/5 make its *negative* sign equally real.

## The OCANNL anchor, and why the 2.5-3.5x is not reproduced

`ocannl/cuda/tuned` on `mlp_small` splits cleanly in two by how long its own search took:

| regime | repeats | pass-1 `compile_s` | X |
|---|---|---|---|
| long search | 1, 2 (and the discarded warm-up 0) | 16.4 s | **+10.3%**, **+8.4%** (warm-up: +34.6%) |
| short search | 3-9 | 3.6-5.2 s | **-0.2%** median, 3/7 positive |

Every one of those ten passes genuinely searched (`searched: true`, `searches: 2`, `replays: 0`
in the `tune` object) -- the provenance field rules out the obvious explanation that the later
runs replayed a cache. What changed is the *cost* of the search: the CUDA driver's JIT cache
(`~/.nv/ComputeCache`, 323 MB with 17,306 files written during this session) is warmed by every
preceding cell, so a "from-scratch" OCANNL search stops being from-scratch after the first few
repeats even with `autotune_cache/` wiped. The residue tracks the length of the search that
preceded the timing, which is consistent with the README's stated mechanism (a searching process
accumulates modules and buffers) -- and it means **`compile_s` in any published CUDA report is a
warm-JIT number unless `~/.nv/ComputeCache` was cleared too.**

Either way the headline number in `README.md` does not survive: the largest OCANNL residue
measured here -- and OCANNL's tuned cell is what that figure describes -- is **+10.3%** on the
smallest kernels, against a documented **2.5-3.5x**; on
`gpt2_mini` it is +0.5%; and the ROCm leg measured -0.2% / -0.1%. Two boxes, two backends, no
reproduction.

## The call: keep every cell single-pass

Reading both legs against the brief's rule (split a searching cell whose `mlp_small` X exceeds
~10%) -- and stating up front the one thing the brief did not specify, since two boxes now
disagree: **the threshold has to be cleared on every measured box, not on any one of them.** That
is a decision, made here and defensible on its own terms rather than derived from the rule, so it
is worth the argument: the two-pass protocol is a property of the published MATRIX, not of a
machine. Reports are read across boxes -- this file's whole reason for existing is that the ROCm
leg's table and this one are compared -- and a cell that is two-pass on gfx1151 and single-pass on
an RTX 5070 Ti produces two numbers that are not comparable with each other, which is the exact
harm the protocol exists to prevent. The alternative, a per-box protocol, was rejected on that
ground and not on the results.

Applied per-box instead, the verdicts would be: tinygrad beam SPLITS on ROCm (+14.9%) and not on
CUDA (+6.4%); `max-autotune` SPLITS on ROCm (+12.3%) and not on CUDA (-2.0%); `torch.compile`
splits on neither by the mlp_small rule. A reader who prefers per-box protocols should take that
reading -- the numbers are the same either way, and both are in the table below.

| cell | CUDA (this leg) | ROCm (gfx1151) | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| tinygrad `--beam N` | +6.4% / +2.3% | +14.9% / +9.0% | **no split** -- over the line on one box, well under on the other |
| `torch.compile` default | -12.0% / -4.0% | +7.2% / +21.2% | **no split** -- the sign itself is box-dependent |
| `torch.compile max-autotune` | -2.0% / -1.1% | +12.3% / +33.9% | **no split**; add the variant single-pass if it is added |
| OCANNL `tuned` (anchor) | +10.3% behind a 16 s search, ~0 behind a 4 s one | -0.2% / -0.1% | protocol kept, rationale re-stated |

No cell clears the line on both boxes, and no cell clears it on the box whose hardware the
README's own rationale names. What the numbers establish about the mechanism needs stating
carefully, because this report contains its own counterexample to the simple version: OCANNL on
`gpt2_mini` searched for **206-613 s** -- by far the most expensive search measured anywhere here
-- and shows **+0.5%**. So "a long search leaves a residue" is false as stated.

Both conditions are needed, and the second is what the counterexample supplies: a residue appears
where an expensive search precedes the timing **and the step is short enough for a per-launch cost
to be a visible fraction of it**. Every positive row is on `mlp_small`, whose steps are 0.05-0.6 ms
(OCANNL +10.3% behind 16 s; beam +6.4%; BEAM=8 +8.3%), and every ~0 row behind a long search is on
`gpt2_mini`, whose steps are 1.1-9.7 ms (OCANNL +0.5% behind 206-613 s; beam +2.3%). That is the
same shape as the README's own "on small CUDA kernels" qualifier, and it is why the cheap-search
regime and the big-kernel regime both come out at zero: in one there is little residue to carry, in
the other it is swamped. So the honest matrix rule is
"single pass, measured at <=X% per cell per box", with X recorded -- which is a result, and it is
what makes the asymmetry defensible instead of merely documented.

The two-pass protocol stays on the OCANNL tuned cell: it is cheap there (the cell is already
two processes), it is the only cell whose `compile_s` is *defined* as a from-scratch search cost,
and it is the only one gated on provenance. It is now justified by a measured <=10.3% rather than
by an unreproduced 2.5-3.5x.

## Two things found on the way (not part of the measurement)

1. **The runner leaves `runners/` on `sys.path`, which wedges every parallel beam search.**
   `runners/tinygrad/run.py` inserts its parent directory on `sys.path` to import `bench_common`
 -- after importing tinygrad, precisely so the `runners/tinygrad/` directory cannot shadow the
   real package. But tinygrad's beam search compiles its candidates in a **`spawn` pool**, and a
   spawned worker re-executes the module top-level with the *parent's* `sys.path`, where the
   `import tinygrad` at line 39 now runs with `runners/` still in front. The path scan finds
   `runners/tinygrad/` as a namespace portion, the editable install's meta-path finder (appended
   *after* `PathFinder`) never gets a look, and every worker dies with
   `ImportError: cannot import name 'Tensor' from 'tinygrad' (unknown location)`. The pool
   respawns them forever, so the search **hangs instead of failing**: the first attempt here sat
   35 minutes at 3% CPU with the GPU idle and had to be killed. Fixed in this branch by dropping
   the path entry again after the import; a cold BEAM=2 search then finishes in 28 s. This affects
   any device whose beam search parallelises (`CUDA`, `AMD`, `NV`, `METAL`, `HIP`) with an editable
   tinygrad -- i.e. exactly the canonical `orchestrate.py --beam N` run on this box.
2. **The `searched` provenance probe is stale for tinygrad >= 0.13** (gh-ocannl-751, filed by the
   ROCm leg with the patch): `instrument_tinygrad_beam` binds `tinygrad.engine.search`, which
   0.13 replaced with `tinygrad.codegen.opt.search`, so every beam cell reports `searched: null`
   and the report's `pass` column prints `?`. The patch from that issue is applied in this branch;
   without it none of the beam rows above could have stated which pass produced them.

Also observed, and **not** explained: one `mlp_small` BEAM=8 pass-1 and one `gpt2_mini` BEAM=2
pass-1 wedged the same way as the `sys.path` bug did (minutes at ~1% CPU, GPU idle) *after* that
bug was fixed, against 55 s and 63 s for the same searches in their other repeats. Both were
killed by the driver's cap and their pairs dropped (hence n=2 and n=4 in those rows). The ROCm
leg reports one wedge of the same shape. Something in tinygrad's parallel beam pool deadlocks
intermittently; it is worth its own issue (gh-ocannl-760).

Raw per-run records (every arm, every repeat, losses, `queued_step_ms`, `retime_step_ms`,
`searched`, the OCANNL `tune` objects) are kept on the box at `$GH675_OUT/records.jsonl`
(99 pairs); say the word and I will attach them.
