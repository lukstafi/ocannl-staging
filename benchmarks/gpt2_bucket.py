"""Bucket a profiled gpt2_mini step by kernel class, following the gh-ocannl-531 method.

Joins two artifacts:

  1. the emitted batch source for the fissioned step -- one translation unit holding every
     ``<routine>__seg<N>`` kernel (``build_files/bench_gpt/*_seg.{cu,hip,metal}``), which is
     where a segment's *identity* lives: its kernel parameters carry the tensor nodes' debug
     names, and the named model weights (``w_q_l0``, ``l0_ffn_w1``, ``wte``, ``gamma_ln1_l0``,
     ...) say what the segment computes;
  2. a per-kernel time table from the platform profiler -- ``rocprofv3 --kernel-trace --stats``
     on HIP, ``nsys stats --report cuda_gpu_kern_sum`` on CUDA -- which says what it cost.

Segment numbering is compile-specific, so the mapping must be derived from the *same* compile
that was profiled; never carry a seg->bucket table between runs.

Buckets are gh-531's four, so the shares are directly comparable to
``benchmarks/report-gh531-profile.md``:

  ffn          FFN GEMMs (up-projection + gelu epilogue, down-projection, their zero-inits)
  attention    q/k/v projections, QK^T, the softmax chain, scores.V, the output projection
  emb_logits   token/positional embedding, the tied lm_head, and the softmax-CE head
  layernorm    LayerNorm chains, residual adds and the remaining elementwise passes

Classification is two-stage and deliberately conservative. A segment naming a model weight is
*seeded* directly from it; every other segment (the pure-intermediate ones -- QK^T, the softmax
chain, zero-inits) inherits, to a fixpoint, from the segments it shares tensor nodes with. A
segment that never resolves is reported as ``other`` rather than guessed at, and the summary
prints the unresolved list so an unclassified tail can never hide inside a bucket share.

Usage:
    gpt2_bucket.py --source build_files/bench_gpt/cross_entropy_loss_fwd__seg.hip \\
                   --stats  prof/out_kernel_stats.csv [--steps 53] [--dump]

# --- what a named tensor node says about its segment --------------------------------------
# Order matters: these are tried in sequence and the first match wins, because a segment
# legitimately names weights from more than one class.
#
# LayerNorm goes FIRST, which is not the obvious order and is worth the paragraph. A gain/bias
# pair is DEFINITIONAL: only a LayerNorm computes with gamma/beta, and no GEMM names them --
# the FFN up-projection and the lm_head read the layer-norm OUTPUT node (`n309_layer_norm`,
# `n794_layer_norm`), never the gains. The reverse is not true. Because the residual stream is
# Virtual, every consumer re-derives it by re-summing all prior contributions (gh-531 bin 2), so
# each LayerNorm's signature also carries `wpe` and the FFN output biases of every LAYER BELOW
# it -- l0 for the layer-1 norms, l0+l1 for layer 2, all four for the final norm. That triangle
# is the re-summation, not an FFN GEMM, and seeding on `l*_ffn_b2` first would file all nine
# LayerNorm sites under FFN and empty the elementwise bucket entirely.
