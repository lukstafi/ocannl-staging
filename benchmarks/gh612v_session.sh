# gh-ocannl-612 VERIFICATION session -- the cell sequence behind benchmarks/report-gh612-hip-verified.md.
#
# Every cell here ships the DEFAULT-PLACEMENT arm, via gh-ocannl-638's `tune_ship_arm=a`. The
# original session (report-gh612-hip.md) profiled arm A in every cell while the search shipped
# whichever arm was faster, so in three of four cells the profiled routine was never executed
# against anything -- the limitation that report states in its verdict. Forcing the arm makes the
# routine whose kernels are profiled the same routine whose losses the run reports, so the parity
# gate covers it and the pass-2 step p50 is a timing OF it.
#
# Why a script rather than a Reproduction block of hand-typed commands: a cell's treatment is a set
# of flags, and EVERY subcommand of that cell -- search, snap, replay, profile -- must repeat it
# exactly. A `replay` that omits `--ocannl_tune_ship_arm=a` still replays from the cache, still
# emits a step_ms record and still passes the driver's two-cache-hit gate, while shipping arm B: the
# pass-2 p50 would be an arm B timing under an arm A label, which is the exact confusion this
# session exists to remove. So the treatment is declared once, per cell, and every subcommand
# derives from it.
#
# Usage:  gh612v_session.sh <block>...
#   trees      resolve and print the three trees with their commits (measures nothing)
#   gh574      the gh-574 pair, 3 reps, arm order alternated: base574A vs feat574A
#   gh573      the gh-573 pair, 3 reps, alternated:           cap8A vs capoffA
#   caps       the cap-default pair, reps 4-6, alternated:    cap8A vs cap4A
#   replays    pass-2 replay (the protocol's step timings) of every cell of every block above
#   structure  snap + profile + finger on rep 1 of the four structural cells, then the diffs
#   capprofile Part 5's per-kernel profile of cap 4, plus the cap-8-vs-cap-4 structural diff
#   gate       LAST: provenance, the arm-A premise, parity over exactly these cells, artifacts.
#              It requires the structural and cap-4 profiles, so run it after structure/capprofile.
#
# Environment: BASE FEAT MASTER are the three built trees (see the report's Provenance for the
