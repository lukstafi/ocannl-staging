(* Fixtures pinning the call shapes the raw %cd accumulation path expands to. "Raw" means no
   [~projections:] is in scope, so ppx_cd's single [process_raw_accum] path constructs the shape
   logic itself and hands it to [Tensor.raw_accum]: unary arities go through [Shape.Transpose],
   ternary ones through [Shape.Broadcast_tern], and every operand -- merge buffers included --
   reaches the assignment through [Tensor.buffer_of]. The binary [Shape.Broadcast] arity is already
   pinned by [test_compose_logic_err]. *)
