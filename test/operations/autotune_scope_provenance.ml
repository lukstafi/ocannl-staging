(* gh-ocannl-687: the action menu enumerates loops inside SCHEDULE-minted [Local_scope] bodies only.

   gh-ocannl-666 taught [Autotune.collect_loops] to descend scope bodies, because since
   gh-ocannl-639 the accumulation mints of [Sched.Unroll { materialize = true }] and [Partition]
   move the per-step / per-segment loops inside the accumulator's scope, where
   [Schedule.rewrite_loop] still reaches them. The IR carried no provenance, so the descent could
   not be aimed: virtualization mints the same construct at every inlined read, and the menu began
   proposing splits, swaps, unrolls AND vectorize retypes for inlined interpolation and reduction
   loops — up to eight descriptors per loop, each costing a candidate compile and, under the
   per-unit cap, displacing a proposal for the main nest.

   The aim is by action CATEGORY, not by loop. An inlined loop keeps its [Vectorized] retype: that
   is one descriptor and the only one with a renderer built for the shape — [try_vectorize_reduce]
   recognizes an inlined reduction's [Set_local] accumulation, while the ENCLOSING loop cannot be
   explicitly vectorized at all, its body holding a [Local_scope] the elementwise vectorizer bails
   on. Dropping the inner loop wholesale destroys that candidate instead of moving it outward, which
   is what the first attempt here did and what PR #424's review round 2 caught.

   [Low_level.scope_mint] is the fact that separates them. The probe is a controlled pair: ONE
   program shape — [out[i] = scope{ acc := out[i]; for k: acc := acc + x[i,k] }] — built twice, the
   two copies differing in nothing but the scope's [mint] field. Both copies' [k] must keep the
   vectorize retype; only the schedule-minted copy's [k] may draw Splits, Swaps and Unrolls. The
   control that makes the negative half discriminating: [k] is registry-nameable in the inlined copy
   too, so what keeps those categories away from it is the provenance decision and not an
   unresolvable binder.

   The last claims are the ones the exclusion has to earn. The retype must stay on the loop that has
   a renderer — [k] in BOTH copies — and must not migrate to [i], which cannot be explicitly
   vectorized whoever minted the scope below it. *)
