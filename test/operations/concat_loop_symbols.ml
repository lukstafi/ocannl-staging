(* gh-ocannl-765: a concatenation component's segments are lowered as SIBLING [For_loop]s with
   different bounds. Lowering used to mint one loop symbol per product component and reuse it for
   every segment, so the emitted nest bound the same symbol twice at two different widths.
   [Low_level]'s per-branch [loop_ranges] threading reads such a nest correctly, but every FLAT
   scanner keyed by symbol misreads it: [def_loop_ranges] (the inlining path) keeps only the last
   segment's width, [affine_accesses] collects two ranges for one symbol, and the canonical
   renderer -- the walk both digests share -- reports the second binder as shadowed, which makes
   the analysis cache decline the routine and the schedule cache call its rendering incomplete.

   The fix is a fresh symbol per SEGMENT loop, which costs nothing at lowering time and removes the
   hazard class. This test pins the emitted shape (distinct binders over the concat's segment
   widths), the canonical renderer's verdict on it, and -- since a symbol change is exactly the
   kind of rewrite that can lower to something structurally pretty and numerically wrong -- the
   executed values of both the forward concatenation and the [Rev_sides] gradient scatter. *)
