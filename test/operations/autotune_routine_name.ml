(* gh-ocannl-669: [Autotune.tune]'s [?name] — naming parity with [Context.compile], and the
   calibration column that reads it.

   Two facts, each invisible before this parameter existed:

   - A comp carrying no [Assignments.Block_comment] — what [Context.compile ?name] exists for, and
   how [lib/parallel.ml] builds its broadcast and all-reduce routines — can be TUNED, not merely
   compiled. Without a name the search died at its first candidate's lowering with the
   [Invalid_argument] of [Assignments.get_name_exn], deep inside the search and saying nothing about
   names. [Autotune.model_default] and [Autotune.placement_surface], the other two drop-ins for
   [Context.compile] here, are pinned on the same nameless comp. - The [routine] column of the
   calibration rows (gh-ocannl-635) READS the name the compiles were given instead of deriving it a
   second time from the block comment. Pinned with a comp that has BOTH — a block comment saying one
   thing, a [~name] saying another — so a reading and a re-derivation disagree. That divergence was
   unreachable while nothing could pass a name, and would have been silent the day something could:
   every row naming the block comment while the kernels it measured, and their generated sources,
   carried the other name.

   The calibration file is pinned by the companion dune rule
   (--ocannl_autotune_calibration_file=autotune_routine_name.tsv) and truncated here at start, so
   reruns in the same _build directory stay self-contained. Timings never appear: only names. *)
