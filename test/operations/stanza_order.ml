(** A test directory's stanzas stay in order of test name, so that independent test additions do not
    meet at the end of a file (gh-ocannl-2193).

    Every new test in [test/operations] used to append its stanzas at the end of one file,
    [test/operations/dune]. Two branches that each add a test then conflict textually though they
    share nothing, GitHub builds no merge-ref jobs for a conflicting pull request, and the branch
    that loses the race rebases after a green head and pays a whole verification cycle: 14 of the 46
    workers of wave-20261111 did, several after their reviewed head was green. The workaround they
    found -- move the block beside related tests -- holds only until the next append.

    The layout that removes the append point is an order every stanza has exactly one place in.
    Below the marker comment a file carries, top-level stanzas are in non-decreasing order of the
    {!group} of the test they belong to, so a new test goes where its name sorts and two additions
    conflict only when their names are neighbours. The directory's own machinery (the config copy,
    the ambient gate, the aggregate aliases with their explanations) sits above the marker and is
    not ordered. The same rule reaches the other append points of a test addition: the members of
    every aggregate alias ([slow], [scans], the hand-written [runtest] lists) are sorted too, above
    the marker and below it.

    A file opts in by carrying the marker, and {!required} lists the files that must carry it: a
    marker dropped in a merge would otherwise turn the whole check off silently.

    The decision is {!findings}, a pure function of a dune file's text, so the controls run the code
    the live check runs, on files built to be refused. *)
