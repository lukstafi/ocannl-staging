(* gh-ocannl-685: the action menu's per-unit cap is shared across its categories, not spent in
   category order.

   [Autotune.menu] builds five category lists — tensorizes, splits, swaps, unrolls, vectorizes — and
   used to cap them with [List.take (tensorizes @ splits @ ...) max_actions_per_unit]. The list is a
   concatenation ordered by category and is NOT ranked (contrast the placement surface's prefix over
   [rank_flip_candidates], where top-N is the intended semantics), so the prefix was arbitrary: a
   unit whose tensorizes alone reach the cap — tensorize proposals are up to 6 role assignments per
   tightly-nested innermost serial triple, so the count scales with the number of matmul-shaped
   nests — offered the search no split, swap, unroll or vectorize action at all. Not fewer of them:
   none. And those are exactly the categories a unit needs when its tensorizes turn out [Op_illegal]
   or unprofitable. Silent search-space loss, with a [menu:] log line reporting the counts BEFORE
   the take, so a truncated menu logged the same numbers as an untruncated one.

   [Autotune.share_cap] is the fix and this is its pin, over synthetic categories (integers stand in
   for proposals) so the claims are about the sharing rule rather than about whichever menu a
   particular lowering happens to produce. The negative control is stated as its own claim: the
   plain prefix the cap used to be starves every category after the first on the same input, so a
   revert fails the representation claim rather than quietly passing. *)

(* === the cap's altitude (PR #424 review, P2): [Autotune.menu]'s [admits] runs BEFORE the cap ===

   The beam expands a GPU incumbent that binds no hardware dimension only through moves that can
   bind one; every other move provably yields another undispatchable candidate. That refusal used to
   run AFTER [menu] had already capped, so a tensorize-rich unit spent its 48 slots across five
   categories and kept only its share of the one category the beam could use — where the old plain
   prefix, by accident of ordering, handed all 48 to the tensorizes. Filtering first makes that the
   rule rather than the accident.

   The pin needs a menu that genuinely overflows, so: twelve sibling loops of extent 8, each
   innermost and zero-origin, which draw two Splits, two Unrolls and one Vectorized retype apiece.
   The discriminator is that admitting ONE category yields MORE of that category than the uncapped
   sharing leaves it — impossible if the filter ran after the cap. *)
