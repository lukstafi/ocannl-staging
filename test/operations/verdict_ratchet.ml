(* gh-ocannl-668: no test source prints a self-decided claim outside `Verdict`.

   gh-ocannl-601 settled the rule. A `(test)` stanza gates a run on two things — the exit status,
   and the diff against the golden — and a test that prints `<claim>: false` and exits 0 has only
   the second. That gate is promotable: the diff fails, the natural next move is `dune promote`, and
   the failure becomes the expected output. In a golden made of verdict lines a blessed regression
   and a deliberately recorded negative fact are the same text, so nothing fails again until someone
   reads the file. Routing the claim through `Verdict` adds the first gate by construction.

   The sweep that converted the 125 literal-label sites then in tree was one-time, and it left no
   mechanical trace. `test/operations/bandwidth_calibration.ml`, written afterwards for
   gh-ocannl-578, arrived with four fresh `Stdio.printf "…: %b\n"` claims and nothing failed,
   warned, or so much as remarked on it -- they were converted much later, in passing, by work whose
   subject was something else. The convention lived in prose, and a new test is written by matching a
   neighbour: in `test/operations` the neighbours are a mixture, legitimate descriptive `%b` prints
   sitting next to converted assertions, so the local example does not teach the rule. This is the
   mechanical trace.

   What it flags is a format whose LAST argument-consuming conversion is a bare `%b` at the end,
   behind a label ending in a colon, an equals sign or an arrow -- in either of two kinds. A LITERAL
   label is written out (`"k-blocks fused: %b\n"`); a COMPUTED one is built from arguments
   (`"%s aligned: %b\n"`, `"Epoch %d, loss below threshold=%b\n"`).

   Both were once out of reach, for different reasons, and gh-ocannl-624 closed both. The computed
   form had nowhere to go: `Verdict.p` takes a label, not a format, so converting a computed claim
   meant splitting the line by hand and every site was a judgement call. `Verdict.pf` and
   `Verdict.claimf` are that missing entry point, and with the sweep done the shape can be held.
   The separator was the quieter half: reading only a colon, this check could not see
   `"round-trip identity = %b\n"` -- the spelling most of the sites it was written for actually
   used, in `data_parallel`, `shard_transfer`, `test_buffer_loc` and a dozen more. Neither hole
   showed up as a failure. Both showed up as a clean report.

   A descriptive `%b` print therefore has one escape hatch left, not two. Carrying a second
   conversion no longer works, because a computed label carries one by construction; what remains is
   a named exemption below with the reason the line is not an assertion. The list is short, and the
   reason it stays short is structural: a print whose boolean is not a verdict is a census row or a
   table, and those rarely END on the boolean. *)

(* Sources whose claim-shaped literals are this check's own input rather than anything printed: the
   table that pins the shape reader on hostile formats, which has to spell the shapes out to pin
   them.

   The file is the honest unit here, not its labels one at a time. That table grows a case whenever
   the reader learns a distinction, so a list of its labels would be a second copy of it, maintained
   by whoever adds the case and read by nobody -- and the labels are fixture words like "fused",
   which say nothing about whether a literal is a print. What keeps the exemption from being a hole
   is the canary list below: two of those literals are named there, and this check fails if its scan
   of this file stops finding them. *)

   that stops being true is not a free pass.

   LITERAL-label sites, keyed by "<repository-relative path>:<label>". Empty, and that is the state
   of the tree rather than an oversight: a bare `"<label>: %b"` line with nothing else on it is an
   assertion in every case the sweeps found. *)
let exempt_sites : (string * string) list = []

(* COMPUTED-label sites, keyed by "<repository-relative path>:<the format up to the boolean>". The
   head rather than the label, because a computed label is only what survives rendering a head whose
   arguments this reader cannot fill in -- a hint for a report, not an identity. And the head rather
   than the whole format, because the whole format IS the claim shape: a list of them written out
   here would be a list of claims in a test source, and this check would have to exempt its own file
   to hold everyone else to the rule. A head stops before the boolean, so it is not one.

   Every entry here but the first is a row of a table or a census, where the boolean records what
   happened rather than deciding whether it was right. Each also carries its assertion separately,
   through `Verdict.claim`/`claimf` on the same bound boolean, which is the pattern that lets a row
   keep its shape without losing its gate -- so what is exempted is the PRINT, never the check. An
   entry whose test has no such claim beside it is an exemption that should not have been granted,
   and that is not a hypothetical: `affine_extraction`'s parallelizability table was exempted here
   while nothing claimed it, so a conflict analysis that stopped seeing the reduction's cross-thread
   dependence would have flipped a row to `true`, exited zero, and been promotable (Codex P2, round
   2). All seven entries were audited against the invariant when that one was found.

   The first entry is the structural exception, and it is the only kind there can be: the body of
   the claim printer itself, which is not a row and has no claim beside it because it IS the claim.
   A second entry of that kind would mean a second gate. *)
