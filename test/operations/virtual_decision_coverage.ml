(* gh-ocannl-805: the assertion at the [virtual_llc] / cleanup boundary.

   The broken shape cannot be produced by the complete optimizer today -- that is the invariant the
   assertion protects -- so the negative control honestly injects hand-built IR into the exposed
   seam validator with a fresh placement table. The positive control sends the same read through
   [Ll_test.optimize], proving the normal analysis + virtualization path decides it and reaches
   cleanup without tripping the seam. *)
