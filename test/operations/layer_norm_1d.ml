(* Regression test for applying layer_norm to a plain 1-D tensor with no batch axes (a term_init
   tensor whose axis placement is decided only by the Total_elems constraint). Two solver bugs used
   to make this silently compute garbage: [compute_row_product] latched the captured row variable
   [d]'s product to 1 while its tail was still an open row variable (so both [/. dim d] divisions
   vanished), and the singleton-bounds equality heuristic equated the mean's fixed-index output
   axis ([=> ... | 0], At_least_dim 1) with its consumer's axis, resolving it to 4 instead of the
   guess-to-1 broadcast (so the mean was only subtracted at index 0). *)
