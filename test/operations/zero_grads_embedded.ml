(* [diff.zero_grads] is an [Assignments.comp] whose [embedded_nodes] is derived where gradients are
   minted (gh-ocannl-771): a routine built out of the zeroing code alone -- which is exactly what
   {!Train.zero_params_grads} does -- must be able to ALLOCATE the gradients it zeroes rather than
   demand them of a prior context.

   The two directions of that derivation fail very differently. A MISSING node fails loudly: linking
   the routine refuses a node that is neither embedded nor already in the context. An EXTRA node
   fails nothing at all -- the routine allocates a buffer nobody asked for, [zero_params_grads]
   quietly claims a gradient it does not zero, and every existing test stays green. So the invariant
   worth pinning is EXACTNESS, in both directions, and this test pins it at both ends of the
   recursion:

   - the base case, {!Tensor.force_param_diff}: a [Tensor.param] mints one fresh gradient and zeroes
     only it, so its [embedded_nodes] must be exactly the singleton [{ p.diff.grad }]. That equality
     is what makes {!Train.zero_params_grads} -- which sequences one parameter's [zero_grads] per
     trained parameter -- mean what its name says;
   - the inductive case, {!Tensor.op}: a composite loss sequences its operands' [zero_grads] and
     appends the zeroing of its own gradient, so its [embedded_nodes] must equal the set of nodes
     its zeroing [Fetch]es actually write. That set is DERIVED from the tree through
     [Asgns.collect_written] rather than written down here: a restatement of the expected gradients
     would pin this test's idea of the graph, not the relationship between the two fields.

   Field agreement is not by itself enough for the inductive case, because both fields come off the
   SAME tree: an operand's [zero_grads] that stopped being folded in shrinks the two together, and
   their equality survives (Codex round 1, P2) while the gradient goes unzeroed across backprop
   runs -- the "missing zero_grads" bug {!Tensor.diff} warns about. Recursion DEPTH therefore gets a
   witness derived from somewhere else: [diff.backprop], an independently built tree over the same
   graph, whose written set is the gradients backprop accumulates into. Every one of them must be
   zeroed, and [zero_grads] must zero nothing beyond them but the loss's own seed gradient. Both
   claims are relationships between two fields; no expected gradient is named anywhere below. *)
