(* Every emitted float constant is a floating literal that parses back to exactly the host value
   (gh-ocannl-623).

   [C_syntax.c_float_literal] renders each [Low_level.Constant] into the kernel source. Three
   properties have to hold of the token it produces, and [%.16g] alone gets all three wrong:

   - It has to be a FLOATING literal. A value with no fractional part printed by [%.16g] has no
     radix point, so it is a C INTEGER literal that the surrounding cast happens to convert. That is
     value-preserving in today's cast contexts for every value but one: [-0.] printed as ["-0"] is
     the integer zero, hence [+0.0] once cast — a live cross-backend data corruption fixed for that
     single value by gh-ocannl-615. The rest of the class is latent, not inert (integer division,
     integer promotion, a digit run outgrowing [long long]), which is what this test closes.
   - It has to ROUND-TRIP. Sixteen significant digits do not recover every double: [0.1 +. 0.2]
     prints as ["0.3"], a different double, and so does [max_float]. Arbitrary host values reach
     this printer (hosted constant inits inline them as scalar stores), so this is a live
     value-changing bug rather than a hypothetical one, and it is invisible to a tolerance-based
     comparison — hence the bitwise checks below.
   - The specials have to be SPELLED. [INFINITY] / [(-INFINITY)] / [NAN] are C99 macros MSL also
     provides and the CUDA and HIP preludes define under [#ifndef]; a NaN's payload and sign do not
     survive any of them, so NaN is checked as "is a NaN" rather than on the bits.
   - A value on an f32 TIE has to be exact, not merely round-tripping. The reasoning that the cast
     does the narrowing holds only where the dialect has a [double]; MSL does not, so Metal rounds
     the decimal itself, at parse time. The two readings agree everywhere except on a tie, where
     the host takes ties-to-even and a decimal near but not equal to the value breaks by whichever
     side it landed on — so the emitted digit count silently decides the value. Ties are therefore
     spelled as exact hexadecimal literals, which no reading has to round.

   Deliberately absent: a precision suffix. The literal is always double-typed and the narrowing is
   [convert_precision]'s cast — one rounding of the exact host double, the same conversion the host
   itself performs. An [f]-suffixed decimal would round the decimal straight to float instead, which
   disagrees for a value on a float tie. The f32 and f16 legs are what pin that the cast is really
   there and really does the narrowing: their oracles are the host's own conversions.

   The twin of this test is [ll_printer_constants], which asks the same two portable questions of
   the IR DUMPS — the [.ll] and [.cd] text a constant bug is actually chased on. Both renderings
   now come out of one helper, [Utils.decimal_float_literal] (gh-ocannl-713); what stays here is
   what only C needs, the specials and the tie's hexadecimal spelling.

   The IR is hand-built so that each constant is stored, untouched, into its own cell of a
   materialized node: through the [Assignments] pipeline a bare constant fill is the backend's
   business to inline or upload, and only an inlined one is about this printer. *)
