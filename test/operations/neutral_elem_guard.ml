(* [Tensor.op] can only learn an operation's neutral element by reading it off the assignments
   [op_asn] built, and [Shape.derive_projections] consumes it (the clamped-window decision and the
   margins' neutral). So the operation's shape update step, whose [neutral_elem] is immutable, is
   only created once [op_asn] has returned, and the [projections] handle [op_asn] receives is a
   promise for it. Forcing the handle from within [op_asn] is rejected before this operation's step
   is registered or anything is derived for it, and so is finalizing inference by another route:
   [Shape.finish_inference] refuses while the construction window is open. The rejection is a bug
   report, not a recovery API: shape inference is not transactional (gh-ocannl-903), so the legs
   below reuse operands only in the pure-force case, where the probe [op_asn] forces before it does
   anything else.

   The rejection is on the invariant and not on whether the missing neutral element would have
   changed a decision, so the legs below span the cases a narrower rule would let through -- no
   neutral element at all, a finite one over a pointwise step, a non-finite one where no padded
   window consults the clamping flag, a finite one whose margins are touched. All are rejected, and
   this test is what a future narrowing has to argue with: the reasoning is at the seam in
   tensor.ml, and it turns on the cost of the call being non-local (forcing the projections runs
   [Shape.finish_inference] over every active update step in the session) rather than on any of
   these cases being individually harmful.

   The last two legs pin what rejecting early buys. The operand of the rejected padded-window leg
   carries no committed padding afterwards -- a derivation that had run against an unknown neutral
   element would have committed margins on it -- and the very same operands then serve the accepted
   control, whose derivation commits their padding with the operation's actual neutral. That reuse
   is the pure-force case above, not a general guarantee. *)
