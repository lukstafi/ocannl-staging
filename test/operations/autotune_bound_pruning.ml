(* gh-ocannl-514 phase 4b: bound pruning against the measured incumbent in [Autotune.tune], config
   [autotune_bound_pruning]. The dune rule pins the cc backend and a tiny envelope (model_peak_* =
   1e3), making the schedule-invariant roofline floor astronomically larger than any measured time —
   every enumerative sketch candidate is then provably unable to win and is pruned before compile,
   deterministically on any machine, while the baseline and presets are exempt and still timed. The
   tuned routine must still compute correct values (the winner comes from the never-pruned
   candidates). *)
