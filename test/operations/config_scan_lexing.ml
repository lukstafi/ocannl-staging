(** How both configuration scanners read a source file, exercised directly.

    [Config_key_scan] decides what counts as code, so every one of its mistakes is silent by
    construction: keys that vanish from a scan look exactly like keys that were never read. Four
    rounds of review on PR #340 found such bugs one at a time -- prose read as a call site, a quoted
    string inside a comment read as a nested comment, a character literal opening a string, an
    escaped literal losing its value -- which is the argument for testing on hostile input rather
    than on the library sources that happen to exist today.

    The scanner parses, with the compiler's own parser behind ppxlib, so most of these are
    regression cases rather than live hazards. They are kept because that is the point: they are
    what says so. *)
