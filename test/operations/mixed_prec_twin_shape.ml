(* gh-ocannl-540: a mixed-precision cast twin must have its master's shape.

   [Operation.cast] is a shape-INFERRED pointwise op, so the twin's batch row starts as an open row
   variable. Read as the weight operand of a BATCHED matmul, that row variable is resolved by the
   use site: the batch axis broadcasts into the twin and it materializes as [batch, out, in] — a
   per-batch-row copy of a weight that has one value for the whole batch.

   Nothing downstream is wrong numerically (every slice holds the same value), which is why the
   loss-trajectory oracle in test/training/mixed_prec_parity.ml never saw it: that model's input
   carries no batch axis, so the twin had nothing to broadcast. The costs are (a) [batch]x the
   twin's memory and cast work every step, and (b) the row symbol appears in the matmul's weight
   operand, which made EVERY tensorized candidate decline on a backend whose only tensor-core route
   is a reduced input format — unstaged seeds fail [Schedule.Tensorize]'s unit-coefficient role
   check (the third micro symbol occurs in an operand), and staged seeds pin the cooperative
   [Stage] load nest inside the row loop (the row symbol is an outer-part symbol of the staged
   source), breaking the perfect nest Tensorize requires. On HIP that was 16 of 28 mma candidates,
   and mma_timed = 0.

   So this pins the shape itself, at every reduced precision and with a batch axis present. *)
