(** Circle counting training test using synthetic dataset.

    This test trains a model to classify images by the number of circles they contain. Uses
    cross-entropy loss for classification.

    {2 Known Issues with conv2d in Training}

    When attempting to use [Nn_blocks.lenet] with SGD training, a shape inference issue was
    encountered:

    1. {b max_pool2d row variable mismatch}: [max_pool2d] uses [..c..] for channel row variable,
    while [conv2d] uses [..oc..] for output channels. When composing [max_pool2d (conv2d x)], the
    shape inference fails with "incompatible stride" errors because the row variables don't unify.

    {b Workaround}: Use an MLP instead - OCANNL's matrix multiplication handles multi-dimensional
    inputs automatically without explicit flattening. *)
