(* Regression test for the data-parallel training driver (task-2445dd1c, subtask 293c).

   A small linear-regression step is run two ways and the resulting parameters are compared: -
   n_shards = 1: the whole logical batch on a single shard (the single-shard baseline); - n_shards =
   2: the same logical batch split along the batch axis across two shards, with the per-shard
   gradients all-reduced via merge-buffer transfer routines before one optimizer step.

   With a sum-over-batch loss and Sum reduction, the all-reduced gradient over the two half-batches
   equals the full-batch gradient exactly, so the two runs must land on identical parameters. The
   test would fail if a shard ran the full batch (the split would be wrong) or if the reduction
   dropped/double-counted a shard. Parameters (not just the loss) are compared. *)
