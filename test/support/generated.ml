(** Freshness-checked reads of the generated-kernel artifacts under [build_files/] (gh-ocannl-655).

    Tests that assert on emitted code read [build_files/<exe>/<routine>.<ext>]. The artifact is a
    side effect of a compile, not a value the test holds, and nothing in the path ties it to the
    compile it is supposed to describe:

    - [test/config/ocannl_config] sets [clean_up_build_files_on_startup=false], so an artifact
      outlives the run that produced it, indefinitely. A test asserting "the kernel contains
      [single_to_fp8]" keeps passing after the kernel stops being emitted at all -- folded to a
      constant, erased by precision inference, fissioned into a differently-named routine -- because
      it is reading the previous run's file. A structural check that has quietly stopped
      structurally checking is worth less than no check, because it is counted as coverage.
    - Within one run, two compiles under the same routine name overwrite each other's artifact. A
      loop that compiles several candidates under one name and credits each with what it finds on
      disk afterwards is crediting candidate N with candidate N-1's source whenever a compile skips
      emission (a schedule-cache hit, a reused artifact, a conditional write).

    So this module owns the read, and makes both cases fail rather than pass:

    - {!init} -- called once, before any compile -- empties this process's own [build_files/<exe>/]
      subdirectory. Every artifact present afterwards was written by this run, so existence *is*
      freshness and no clock is involved. What makes that safe is that the DEFAULT subdirectory is
      derived from the executable's own name and dune runs one process per executable, so nothing
      else writes there. The other two resolutions are not this process's to empty and get their own
      treatment: any configured [build_files_prefix], flat or named, is refused, because that
      directory is not this process's to empty (a second executable can be given the same prefix)
      and without deletion nothing distinguishes a re-emitted identical kernel from a stale one --
      deletion is the only write signal independent of timestamp granularity.
    - {!read} fails the run (through {!Verdict}, so the exit status carries it and no [dune promote]
      can bless it) when the artifact is missing. Silence must not be indistinguishable from a pass,
      which is what a [string option] returning [None] invited: some call sites recorded that as
      [false], others forgot it.
    - Reading one routine twice, with the artifact's contents having changed in between, is reported
      as an overwrite: within a run that is a same-named second routine, or an unarmed second
      candidate. {!arm} -- delete this routine's artifact, right before compiling the candidate that
      should produce it -- is how a loop says the overwrite is intended, and turns "was it really
      candidate N's kernel?" into a checked fact for each candidate in turn.

    A test whose leg the backend cannot evaluate (a GPU intrinsic on a CPU backend) must not reach
    {!read} at all: gate the leg and report it with [Verdict.skipped]. An absent artifact is a
    failure here, deliberately. *)

(* Whether wholesale cleanup of the artifact directory is this process's to do.

   Only the DEFAULT, executable-derived subdirectory is inherently process-private: dune runs one
   process per executable, so nothing else writes there. Every other resolution can be shared -- the
   flat layout by definition, and an explicit [build_files_prefix] because two executables can be
   given the same one -- and emptying a shared directory would delete a concurrently running test's
   kernel between its compile and its read. So the three cases get three behaviours rather than one:
   sweep, refuse, or establish freshness per routine through {!arm}. *)

   property is "nobody configured this directory, so it is mine by construction" -- and no
   comparison of the result can establish that: [build_files_prefix=<this exe's own basename>]
   resolves exactly where the default would, while remaining a prefix a second executable can be
   given too. The empty string is what [Utils.artifacts_subdir] itself treats as "unset". *)

   that reports an unusable artifact directory and carries on hands the rest of the test exactly the
   directory it just refused -- and {!arm}, which deletes, would then run against it. The exit
   status arriving eventually at teardown does not help: by then the deletions have happened. So
   refusing the DIRECTORY aborts the process, at the point of refusal, before any compile or cleanup
   can go through it. Exit 1 rather than an exception, matching what [Verdict]'s own teardown would
   produce: [Stdlib.exit] runs that teardown on the way out, so the failure is still reported

   raising -- a Windows sharing violation, a read-only directory, or a file another process holds
   open all leave the path in place. Deleting something that was not there is not a failure, which
   is why the verdict is on [file_exists] afterwards rather than on the exception. *)

   [Unix.lstat] for exactly this reason; the same question has to be asked here, of the destructive
