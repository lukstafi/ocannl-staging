(** Prose claiming that partial sums are exact, and whether a derivation stands beside it
    (gh-ocannl-1729).

    A bitwise claim over a reduction rests on a premise: the summands are such that every partial
    sum, in whatever association the backend chooses, is exactly representable at the accumulator,
    so every correct schedule returns the same bits. Written in prose, that premise was wrong twice
    (gh-ocannl-1658: the magnitudes did not fit the format the comment named), and nothing could
    notice, because a comment is not evaluated. [Ll_test.exact_partials] derives it from the
    summands themselves (gh-ocannl-1693), so the rule is: prose that states the premise sits beside
    the claim that derives it.

    {1 What it reads — a LINT, and its boundary}

    This is a best-effort prose reader, fail-closed over a short phrase list, not a model of what a
    sentence means. Precisely:

    - THE TEXT: every comment (documentation comments included) and every string literal of the
      source, as {!Prose_lexemes} reads them with the compiler's lexer.
    - A CLAIM: one sentence of that text — split at [.], [;], [!] or [?] followed by whitespace or
      the end, and at a blank line — holding both the phrase [partial sum] or [partial sums] (one
      word each, any case, hyphenated or not) and the word [exact] or [exactly]. Words are maximal
      runs of letters, digits, [_] and [']: [exact_partials] and [inexact] are words of their own,
      neither of them [exact], and [f32-exact] holds the word [exact].
    - WHAT IT DOES NOT READ: any other wording of the premise ("every association rounds nowhere",
      "the accumulation is exact", "dyadic inputs: any schedule computes the same bits"). A missed
      phrasing is a gap of this lint, not a pass the rule grants; widening the list is one follow-up
      issue, not a review round.
    - NEGATION, read crudely: a sentence holding any of the words {!negations} ([not], [never],
      [inexact], [round], [rounds], [isn't], [aren't]) is not a claim, whatever it negates — "the
      inputs are exact while their partial sums are not" states the opposite premise, the one a
      discrimination claim exhibits rather than derives. So "every partial sum is exact, not
      approximate" is read as no claim: a missed phrasing, on the side the header already gives up.

    {1 What "beside" means}

    A claim is COVERED when the top-level structure item it sits in — or, for prose between two
    items, the item that follows it, which is the item a leading comment describes — contains a
    reference to [Ll_test.exact_partials], spelled with that path. Read on ppxlib's parse tree, so a
    reference is code, never the identifier quoted in prose. So a file header stating the premise
    for legs further down is uncovered: it points at the leg whose claim derives it instead.

    Not resolved: what the path names (a local [module Ll_test] shadowing the library's would
    count), whether the reference's result reaches a [Verdict] claim, and whether its [~sig_bits]
    matches the format the prose names. A bare [exact_partials] after an [open Ll_test] does not
    count, which errs toward refusal. *)
