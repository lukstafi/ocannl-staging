(** Finding self-decided verdicts that a test prints itself instead of routing through {!Verdict}.

    gh-ocannl-601 established the rule and swept the sites that existed then: a claim the test
    decides — [<label>: <bool>] — must go through [Verdict], so that a failure exits the process
    nonzero. Printed and exited 0, the same line is gated only by the golden diff, and the natural
    next move on a failing diff is [dune promote], which records [<label>: false] as the expected
    output. In a golden that is nothing but verdict lines, a blessed regression and a deliberately
    recorded negative fact are the same text.

    That sweep was one-time and left no mechanical trace, so the population regrew: a test written
    afterwards ([bandwidth_calibration], gh-ocannl-578) came in with four fresh
    [Stdio.printf "…: %b\n"] claims, and nothing failed or warned. This module is the reader behind
    the ratchet that stops that (gh-ocannl-668).

    {1 What shape is recognised}

    A format whose LAST argument-consuming conversion is a bare [%b] at the end, behind a label that
    ends in one of the separators a claim is written with — a colon, an equals sign, or an arrow.
    Two kinds, told apart by whether anything else in the format consumes an argument:

    - {!Literal_label}: the [%b] is the only conversion, so the label is written out.
      ["k-blocks fused: %b\n"], ["round-trip identity = %b\n"], ["hoisted -> %b\n"].
    - {!Computed_label}: the label is built from arguments. ["%s fused: %b\n"],
      ["Epoch %d, loss below threshold=%b\n"].

    Both are recognised now. The literal form was gh-ocannl-668's; the computed one is gh-ocannl-624,
    which the sweep of that issue converted onto {!Verdict.pf} and {!Verdict.claimf} — entry points
    that did not exist when this reader was written, which is why the shape was out of scope then
    and is not now. The separator vocabulary is the other thing that widened: a reader that accepted
    only a colon was blind to the whole ["… = %b"] population, and that is how the claims in
    [data_parallel], [shard_transfer] and [test_buffer_loc] sat outside a check written to catch
    exactly them.

    The escape hatch is narrower as a result, and deliberately so. A descriptive print used to
    escape by carrying a second conversion; a computed label carries one by construction, so that no
    longer distinguishes it. What is left is a named exemption in the test that consumes this — one
    per site, with the reason it is not an assertion. The population that needs one is small (a
    handful of census rows and tables), because a print whose boolean is not a verdict usually does
    not end on the boolean.

    {1 Why it reads the parse tree}

    Same argument as {!Config_key_scan}, whose parse helpers this shares, and the same conclusion:
    this module parses, it does not match text. A text scan reads prose as code — this file's own
    documentation quotes the shape it hunts — and cannot tell a format written over a line
    continuation from one written on a line. On the parse tree a string literal carries its decoded
    value whatever escapes or delimiters produced it.

    Attribute payloads are the one thing deliberately skipped. A documentation comment becomes an
    [@@@ocaml.doc] attribute holding a string, so a comment quoting the shape arrives as a literal
    to flag; that is prose, and prose is not a print. Extension payloads are {e not} skipped — a
    [%cd] or [%expect] payload is code, or is the golden text of one.

    {1 Every claim-shaped literal, not only those applied to a [printf]}

    What the check fails on is the literal, wherever it sits; which function receives it is reported
    but decides nothing. The alternative — flag only what is applied to a printing function — is
    evaded by any wrapper, including the [let p name b = Stdio.printf "%s: %b\n" name b] helpers
    several tests defined before {!Verdict} existed. Those helpers are the exact population this
    ratchet exists to keep from regrowing, so a claim-shaped format string in a test source is
    either an assertion or, by exemption, a documented exception. *)

(** The separators a claim is written with, longest first so that a head ending in ["->"] is not
    read as ending in ["-"] by a shorter match. A colon is what the gh-ocannl-601 sweep normalised

    blind to most of the population. *)
let separators = [ "->"; ":"; "=" ]

(** [claim_of format] is the label of the claim [format] prints and which kind it is, when it prints
    one.

    Three things must hold at once:

    - the LAST argument-consuming conversion is a bare [%b] — a width or a flag means the print is
      laying out a column, which is formatting rather than asserting;
    - what follows it prints as whitespace, or as nothing: a newline, a blank line, a [%!] flush;
    - what precedes it ends in one of {!separators}, with a non-empty label before it.

    So ["k-blocks fused: %b\n"] yields [Some ("k-blocks fused", Literal_label)] and
    ["%s fused: %b\n"] yields [Some ("fused", Computed_label)] — the second's label is what survives
    rendering the head, which drops the conversions it cannot fill in, so it is a report's hint
    rather than the site's identity; an exemption for a computed site is keyed by the whole format.
    ["fused: %b (expect false)\n"] and ["fused? %b\n"] yield [None]: neither is the bare claim form,
    and a reader cannot take their boolean at face value. *)
