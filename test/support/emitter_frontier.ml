(** The values that hand a caller the TEXT of generated code, read off the compiler libraries'
    interfaces (gh-ocannl-748).

    {!Test_utils.Codegen_text_scan} recognises a test as reaching generated text in memory when it
    calls one of these. That set used to be written down in the scan -- five names -- and it was the
    one hand-maintained frontier left in the codegen-text inventory: a way of getting emitted text
    into a test that the list does not name does not shrink the inventory {e visibly}, it just
    leaves files off it, and three of the four review rounds on gh-ocannl-712 found a member of
    exactly that shape ([compile_proc], then [compile_main], then [Canonical_render.emit], which
    writes into a buffer instead of returning a document and so was invisible to a list written from
    the first two).

    So the set is derived from what the libraries export, and derived from their {b types} rather
    than from their sources. That distinction is the whole reason this module reads compiled
    interfaces: [C_syntax.compile_proc] carries no return annotation and its module has no [.mli],
    so its result -- a tuple whose second component is the kernel's document -- exists only as an
    inferred type. A source-level scan would have to be told about it, which is the frontier again.
    A [.cmi] holds the type the compiler inferred, whether or not anyone wrote it down.

    {1 What counts}

    An emitter is an exported value whose {b result} mentions [PPrint.document] -- the type every
    renderer in this tree produces -- or which takes a [Buffer.t] {b argument}, the shape
    [Canonical_render.emit] has: the text lands in the caller's buffer instead of coming back. The
    result is what is left of the type after its arrows, tuples and type arguments included, so
    [compile_proc]'s triple counts and [Low_level.lower], which merely {e accepts}
    [ll_source:(PPrint.document -> unit)] callbacks, does not.

    The buffer labels come back with the emitter, because the scan needs them: a call
    [CR.emit ~buf policy llc] deposits generated text in [buf], so [buf] carries the same taint a
    returned document would.

    Both types are recognised through the library's own abbreviations for them: an interface records
    the path a declaration spells, so [type rendered = PPrint.document] followed by
    [val emit : ir -> rendered] would otherwise hide the document behind a name (see
    {!transparent_aliases}).

    Over-inclusion is deliberate here, and it is the direction this whole scan errs in: a fragment
    renderer like [C_syntax.pp_scalar] is an emitter by this rule, and if a test calls it, it is
    pinning emitted text. The cost of a name too many is an inventory line; the cost of a name too
    few is a file silently missing from it.

    {1 What is read}

    The caller hands over [.cmi] files. A library's wrapper interface ([ir.cmi]) is a list of module
    ALIASES, which is how this module knows which modules the library has without being told: the
    alias list is the declaration, the member interfaces are what gets walked, and
    [codegen_text_inventory] fails when the two disagree. That is the guard against the silent
    failure a derivation has instead of a stale list -- handed nothing, a scan finds nothing and
    says so cheerfully. *)

    [Canonical_render] and [t] inside [Low_level] are both spelled bare where they are used.

    What this cannot resolve is a path through a local module alias: [C_syntax] binds
    [module Tn = Tnode] and its interface records [Tn.t], which names no module this scan reads.

    environment; what is needed here is narrower and needs none, since the declarations arrive in the
    same interfaces the values do: take every manifest that is a document (or a buffer), then repeat
    until nothing new is found, so a chain of abbreviations resolves like a single one.

    generation does.
